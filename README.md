# Taal: Civilizations Unleashed

Taal is an ambitious open-source 3D browser game that combines the strategic gameplay mechanics of games like Anno and Civilization, without being bound to a limited world by being set in an infinitely large, procedurally generated world of cubed tiles â€” all within your web browser.

## Project Direction

Taal's development is an exciting journey with an evolving vision. While I currently plan to incorporats elements inspired by Anno and Civilization, its future could potentially include:

**Realistic Simulation**: Aim to simulate real-life as accurately as possible, including:

- A large, detailed tech tree
- Creation of a unique religion that can spread (similar to Civilization)
- Introduction of a custom currency, dynamic market prices, and economic systems
- AI-controlled cities for trading and strategic interactions
- Multiplayer functionality for collaborative and competitive gameplay experiences

However, the direction of Taal is not set in stone. I am open to new ideas and perspectives. Your creativity might lead us in unexpected and innovative directions. Feel free to contribute your thoughts and proposals!
